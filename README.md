# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A self-taught programmer from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ with a knack for crafting scalable backend applications. I am fluent in typescript/javascript, python, and exploring go and rust. In my free time, you can find me configuring my Neovim configs apart from programming I love cycling, gaming and music.
