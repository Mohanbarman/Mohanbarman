# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A self-taught programmer from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ with a knack for crafting scalable backend applications. I am fluent in typescript/javascript, python, and exploring go and rust. In my free time, you can find me tinkering with my Neovim config.<br><br>
Apart from programming I love cycling, gaming, and music.
